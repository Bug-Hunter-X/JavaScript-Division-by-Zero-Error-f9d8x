# JavaScript Division by Zero Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains code that does not handle this case properly, leading to runtime errors. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks robust error handling for division by zero, causing the program to crash when attempting to divide by zero. This is a common problem that can be easily avoided with proper error checking.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a check to ensure the divisor is not zero before performing the division.  This prevents the runtime error and ensures the program's stability.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `bug.js` file to see the error.
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` file to see the corrected code.
